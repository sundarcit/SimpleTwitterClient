This is a simple twitter client.

The completed user stories are as follows.

      User should be able to see the user, body and timestamp for tweet

    User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the list using "infinite scroll" pagination
    User can compose a new tweet
      User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
      User will have a Compose view opened
      User can enter a message and hit a button to post to twitter
      User should be taken back to home timeline with new tweet visible (This is not working . So commented the code)
